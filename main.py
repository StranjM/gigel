#Python crash course

#Chapter one: Variables

#Variables are units that can store data -
#Example:

name = "Mango"
age = 99
alcoholAddict = True
 
#first we need a name for the variable (name, age, alcoholAddict)
#then we need an = to assign data
#last thing u need is the data. there are many kinds of data

# - integer (int) (number without .)
# - float (number with .)
# - char (single character)
# - string (a sequence of characters)
# - boolean (two possible values: True or False; named after George Boole) those are the kinds of data? yes all? understood there are more but irrelevant for now

age = 17 #integr (int) heyo run the script
size = 1.89 #float
name = "StranjM" #string
firstLetter = 'S' #char
serverMember = True #boolean

#the value (data) can be changed

#to print stuff in the console u need to use print(what you want to print)
#example:

print(age)
print(size)
print(name)
print(firstLetter)
print(serverMember)

#now run this script hellooooooooooo wait, are the data names important? yes you need the name to access the data and how do i find it if i dont know it you have to remember the name damn the variables you create in this scirpt only work in this script ooh i believe i had something similar in js where i had the name, version and stuff yes yes "client" in discord.py is a variable too so they are similar yes good but how does this help me you need to understand how python works
# i am very sorry but i think i have to go. we can do it tomorrow or when you have time i always have time, you just ping me sure
#bye! bye bye
